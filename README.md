# Sarcasm Detection using NLP & Deep Learning

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (LSTM) to detect sarcasm in news headlines.

## Features
- Preprocesses text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Uses a TensorFlow Keras-based model with word embeddings.
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
- Allows real-time sarcasm prediction.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd sarcasm-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
